          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
              The goal of this project is to highlight differences between two contrasting images taken
              of the same scene at different points in history or at different times of day by combining
              them to create a visual timeline output image. This will be accomplished by compositing two
              input images into one blended image where each image takes up about half of the space in the
              final processed image. In order to combine the images, we will use the Laplacian Pyramid
              Blending method to seamlessly combine the images, creating a composite output image of the
              two input images in the middle and leaving the originals unchanged further from the center.
          </p>
          <h2>Introduction & Motivation</h2>
          <p>
              Image compositing and blending has been around quite some time, but the idea of blending images
              of same scene at different times of day or even decades has been relatively new.  The technique
              of image compositing was invented in the 1880s after a suggestion for registering photographs of
              human faces on the two eyes to create an average photograph of all those in the group.  With the
              advancement of the computer technology in the 1990s, image compositing technique has greatly
              improved using computer graphics software.
          </p>
          <p>
              Previous works done blending images of the same scene at different times are very limited and were
              done manually, mostly using Photoshop.  In this project, image compositing and blending will be
              done using Matlab programming.  There are many techniques for blending images, this project will use
              Laplacian Pyramid Blending.  This content-based blending technique using edge features, hides seams
              but preserve sharp details in order to produce an output visual timeline photo that transitions
              discretely between the old and the new photo.
